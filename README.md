# Dino Game AI #
## Game ##
The game itself was developed with the Pygame module
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Agent ##

The agent file would contain the following modules
* Game
    * model
    * Training:
        * state = get_state(game)
        * action = get_move(state)
            * model.predict()
        * reward, game_over, score = game.play_step(action)
        * new_state = get_state(game)
        * remember
        * model.train()

## Game(Pygame) ##
The Game.py file would contain the following modules
* play_step(action)
    * reward, game_over, score

## Model(Pytorch) ##
* The Model.py file would contain the following modules
    * Linear_QNet(DQN)
        * model.predict(state)
            * action
